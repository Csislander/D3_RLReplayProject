Please don't hesitate to ask for a live demo!

The three most important files for this project are:

RLVizServer.js, which handles server setup, and post request from client
index.html, in the Public folder. This file contains all the code for creating the visualizations (inline javascript - d3)

Instructions for running:

1. Install node and npm

2. Go to the project folder in a terminal, and type "npm install" to install necessary packages

3. Type "node RLVizServer.js" to begin the server

4. Navigate in a browser to localhost:8888

5. Upload a replay from the Replay folder, use a replay from URL given in SampleURLReplays.txt, or use your own replays

6. Try it out
